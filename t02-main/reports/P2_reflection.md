# Reflection

What we did well: 
    This sprint, our communication improved significantly. We started meeting twice a week, rather than
    once, which helped all of our team stay on the same page. Another thing we did well this sprint was organize our issues better which helped in knowing our progress throughout the sprint. We also came together as a team more and were more helpful, which made teamwork a lot easier. 

What we didn't do well:
    Communication can always be improved. It seems the team members have very conflicting schedules, which makes it hard for us to consistently meet. While the second weekly meeting did help with this, we still had meetings without everyone showing up. 

Possible Improvements: 
    The team has talked about imposing a policy to let the rest of the team know if you are unable to show up to a meeting, so we know who will miss out and who we will need to fill in. Another possible improvement is to try and get everyone to look at teams at least once a day, just to stay up to date with the project and see what could possibly be done.
