# Reflection

What we did well: 
    This sprint by far was our best one in terms of working as a team and communication. The teammembers were very active within the teams channel and we had consistent pull requests throughout the sprint. The team worked well with React and the frontend side of the application. We were able to get all of the functionality working for the demo. Overall it was a very productive sprint.

What we didn't do well:
    As said in other reflections, communication can always be improved. The low point of communication of this sprint was near the end, where most of the team was also busy with work from other classes. We also had a few issues with the Use Cases report and had to redo it a couple of times.
