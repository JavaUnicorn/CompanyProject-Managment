# General Reflection

### Britta's reflection 
    **The Good:**
        We at times had decent communication and would have times where atleast half the team was on the same page.
    **The Bad:**
        We rarley were ever on the same page like Cole said and that made things difficult. We had members that would go missing for a week or two and we just assumed they weren't responding. Weekly meetings also had poor attendance usually only two people would show up and we never had all the team in the meeting at once since the start of the semester. Entirly we just struggled with making sure we all understood what was happening in the team, it felt like half the team never knew what was happening, because they weren't checking teams or weren't asking soon enough.
    **The Improvments:**
        Communication was none existent to lacking to say the least. I would like to see everyone more engage in the teams channel and better checking of github as well since there was a few times prs would be sitting for a day or more. I'd also like to see someone trying to take charge of makeing sure we're holding each other accountable for the deadlines we self impose. I think I also agree with Cole starting the Sprints earlier and getting help sooner is also something we need to improve on since we were lost for almost half the sprint before we went to get help.

### Cole's two cents
In my opinion this sprint was a great example of how not to communicate. It rarely felt like we ever had all six team members on board with a single plan of action, until the very end of the sprint when we were in panic mode. We did communicate some deadlines well in the teams channel, but it we had a hard time confirming everyone was on board. We split up methods, and responsibilities well, but again we failed to get everyone on board with early self imposed deadlines. Overall we can plan ahead better, and communicate better moving forward. Another thing we did poorly was we did not begin early enough, so we were behind and forced to work right up to the deadline, which was overall very stressful for all involved. In future sprints I would like to be done a week or bare minimum a few days before the end of the sprint, so we have time to wrap up documentation related issues and other odds and ends. Moving forward I think we will try to set and enforce team agreed upon deadlines better, and communicate those more clearly by reaching out to team members who have not confirmed whether they agree with these deadlines and will attempt to abide by them or not.
